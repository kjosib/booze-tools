Welcome to booze-tools documentation!
=======================================

Booze-Tools aims to be the ultimate Swiss-Army Knife of
language-processing tasks. It does quite a bit so far,
and has some features not found in other such tools.
It happens to be written in Python.

Project Maturity Level:
   The deep algorithmic stuff works like a champ,
   but there are some rough edges. Some APIs may change,
   but the general concept to keep the grammar definition
   independent of the target-language is not going anywhere.
   (In concept, this should allow a compiler, a pretty-printer,
   and an IDE to all run from the same grammar definition.)
   It's used in a few different projects and generates feedback.

Why the odd name?
   * A few programming languages were named for beverages.
   * Booze is a beverage.
   * I could find no programming language called Booze.
