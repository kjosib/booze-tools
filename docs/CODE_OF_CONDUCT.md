# Code of Conduct

1. Be excellent to each other.
2. If that fails, at least don't be a pain to each other.
3. If that fails, work it out amongst yourselves. You're grown, right?
4. If that fails, the maintainer reserves the right to send you both to your respective rooms.
5. There is no rule 5.

This is meant to be a dedication of something nice to the public at large. Don't mess that up.
