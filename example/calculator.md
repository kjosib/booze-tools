# Calculator Example
This is an example scanner/grammar for a simple desktop calculator with variable assignment and recollection.
It mainly exists to exercise the precedence-parsing facility of `MacroParse`, and also to stimulate the
development of the runtime.

For a rather more verbose tutorial introduction to most of `MacroParse`, please see [json.md](json.md) in this
folder.
