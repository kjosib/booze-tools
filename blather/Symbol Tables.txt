Symbol Tables:
================

In a derivative project, I instantly grasped that mere (Python) dictionaries were
insufficient for decent symbol tables:

1.	Dictionary assignment can forget an existing value. Usually you'd prefer to
	complain about the input instead.

2.	Dictionaries don't naturally track where in the input some name got assigned.
	This is a problem if you'd like error messages to include location information.

Here are a few thoughts on the design of a symbol table for your translator.
Later, I may codify some of this into the support sub-package, and then perhaps
rely on it in an upgraded version of the macro-parse compiler.


The simple approach
---------------------

It's straightforward to write a wrapper around a dictionary which checks whether
a key already exists before allowing assignment, perhaps throwing a derivative
of `KeyError`.

What counts as a symbol-table entry also requires some conscious design choices.
The keys may well be strings, but values probably carry a lot of metadata which
becomes critical for constructing good error reports. Also, forward declarations.


Dealing with (nested) scope
----------------------------

The natural approach is to arrange query-methods to look at parent-scopes as
needed -- which means tracking that relationship somehow. And this also means
the client-application (translator) might need to data about which scope a
name was found in, which is another attribute to track and return.


Entry Type Assertions
-----------------------

Designs change. You try to update everywhere that makes an entry, but one slips
through to send a value of the wrong type. Catch it up front. Invoke a type
assertion in the symbol-assignment method. But which? Pass a predicate to the
symbol table's `__init__` method. Details are an exercise for the reader.


New facts about an old symbol
-------------------------------

Some languages allow (or require) you to separate a declaration from a definition.
This is particularly prevalent when "declare before use" is the rule.
That means potentially multiple facts about a symbol, each with some sort of
"fact kind" and its own location information. Several approaches make sense.


Indirect Inclusions
-----------------------

Maybe you have a way to import declarations from one scope into another. Then it
becomes possible to have an indirect symbol conflict. It's worth making sure the
error protocol can handle this...
