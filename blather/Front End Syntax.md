## Essential Elements of Information
  
* IterableScanner Definition:
  * Character set and localization (currently implied)
  * An optional "initial scan condition" declaration
  * Inclusion and fall-back relations among scan conditions
  * Named Sub-Expressions
  * Rules, potentially within scan conditions

* Parser Definition
  * Initial symbol or symbols, as with MiniParse
  * Precedence and associativity declarations
  * Rules, including both normal and macro-type
